### 6. CSS Activity

Please download the exercise files (above) and use the CSS Property Cheatsheet (above) and what you've learned about selectors to make the following drawing:

<img class="large" src="/spring2024/assets/images/lectures/lecture04/gallery.png" />

<!-- <a href="/spring2024/course-files/lectures/lecture04.zip" class="nu-button">Download Lecture Files <i class="fas fa-download"></i></a> -->

#### Some extra challenges (if you have time)
1. Make one of the image "cards" have a different background color.
2. Try using a custom Google font instead of one of the built-in system fonts.
3. Make a hover effect: when your user mouses over one the cards, make it do something (fade, grow, change colors, etc.).
