## Required: DOM Manipulation
Open the `quiz03` folder and add click event handlers to all of the div tags. When a div element is clicked, its background should change color (pick any color you like). When youâ€™re done, your page should look like the demo shown below:


<img class="medium frame" src="/spring2024/assets/images/quizzes/quiz03/exercise01.gif" />

## What to Submit
**Please read carefully:** Update your homepage by adding a link to `quiz03`.Sarah's final exam looks like this: <a href="https://vanwars.github.io/csci185-coursework/" target="_blank">https://vanwars.github.io/csci185-coursework/</a>

After committing and syncing your changes to GitHub, paste the following links into the Moodle under the Quiz 3 submission section:

1. A link to your **homepage** on GitHub pages.
2. A link to your GitHub **code repository** (where your code files are stored).

If your GitHub is not working for whatever reason, just zip your **COMPLETED** `final-exam` folder and upload it to the Moodle.
