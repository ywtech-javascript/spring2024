## Set-Up

<a href="/spring2024/course-files/quizzes/quiz02.zip" class="nu-button">Quiz 2 Starter Files <i class="fas fa-download"></i></a>

* Download the starter files and unzip them. They should be unzipped in a folder called `quiz02`.
* Move your `quiz02` folder into your `csci185/quizzes` folder.
* Open your entire `csci185` folder in VS Code.

Your directory structure should look something like this (it's OK if your file structure looks different, so long as the quizzes folder looks like the one below):

```bash
csci185
├── homework
├── index.html
├── lectures
├── quizzes
│   ├── quiz01
│   └── quiz02
├── styles.css
└── tutorials
```

When you're done with that, complete the Parts 1-7 as described below:

1. (20pts) [Header](#part1)
1. (15pts) [Google Fonts](#part2)
1. (25pts) [Main](#part3)
1. (10pts) [Accessibility](#part4)
1. (10pts) [Pseudo-classes &nbsp; transitions](#part5)
1. (15pts) [Responsive layout](#part6)
1. (5pts) [Link from your homepage](#part7)
{:.compact}

## Your Tasks

{:#part1}
### Part 1. Header [20pts]
Make the header section look like the picture below, following the guidelines provided:

* [10pts] Use **Flex**
* [5pts] Links should be white with no underline
    * Hint: the `text-decoration` property controls whether a link is underlined.
* [5pts] Don't forget the spacing surrounding the image and navigation
{:.compact}

{:#part2}
### Part 2. Google Fonts & Header Styling [15pts]

* [10pts] Use the "Passion One" Google font to style the `h1`, `h2`, and `h3` tags.
* [2.5pts] Center-align the `h1` tag (Our Menu), and give it a top margin of `30px`
* [2.5pts] Add `80px` of top margin to the `h2` tag.
{:.compact}

When you're done, the fonts should look like the ones pictured in the [Part 3](#part3) screenshot.


{:#part3}
### Part 3. Main [25pts]
Within the `main` section of your HTML page, create layout shown below by following the guidelines:

* [12.5pts] The section with the class of "cards" should be a two-column grid (each column should be the same width).
    * Hint: you'll only need to specify the columns, **not** the rows, as the cards will be positioned into the next available grid cell by default.
    * Note the spacing between columns and rows
* [12.5pts] Each section with a class of "card" should also be a two-column grid (the second column should be narrower than the first).
    * Make sure you add a border around each card
    * Make sure you apply some padding within each card
    * Make sure that the images inside of each card span `100%` of the width of their container.

{:#part4}
### Part 4. Accessibility [10pts]
Use the WAVE browser extension to fix any accessibility errors. When you're done, you should have no accessibility errors.
* You **do NOT** have to submit a screenshot of your accessibility report.
* You **do** have to correct all the errors.

{:#part5}
### Part 5: Pseudo-classes & Transitions [10pts]
Create a rule for all of the "card" sections so when you hover over them:

* [2.5pts] the text color turns white
* [2.5pts] the background color turns navy blue (`#013672`)
* [5pts] Ensure that the transition is smooth
    * Hint: add the `transition` property to the card class rule (not to the pseudoclass).

{:#part6}
### Part 6: Responsive Layout [15pts]
Create a media query that activates when the width of the screen is **800px or less**. Within the media query, implement the following rules:

* [10pts] Overide the section with the class of “cards” so that it's a one-column grid.
* [5pts] Target the `nav` element and set its display to "none" so that the navigation does not display in the tablet or mobile views.


{:#part7}
### Part 7: Add a link from your homepage [5pts]
1. Update your homepage by adding a link to the `index.html` file that you made in this quiz (and make sure you are using a relative link). Sarah's quiz looks like this:
* <a href="https://vanwars.github.io/csci185-coursework/" target="_blank">https://vanwars.github.io/csci185-coursework/</a>
2. Commit and sync your changes to GitHub.

</div>

### Submit to the Moodle
**Please Read Carefully:** To submit Quiz 2, paste the following links into the Moodle under the Quiz 2 submission section:

1. A link to your **homepage** on GitHub pages.
