## Introduction 
Today you are going to write a program that can add, subtract, multiply, and divide the two numbers. The answer should be output below the calculator as shown in the video below:

## Your Tasks

<a href="/spring2024/course-files/labs/lab02.zip" class="nu-button">Download Lab 2 <i class="fas fa-download"></i></a> 

Please download the `lab02.zip` file, unzip it, and move the `labs` folder inside of your `ywtech-javascript` folder.

## Hints
* To access the numbers that the user types into the input boxes, you will access the `value` attribute.
* You will have to convert the values to numbers (they come in as strings). To do this, user the `Number()` function.

## Optional Enhancements
* Add a "clear" button that clears out the text boxes and the gray box.
* Ask ChatGPT to make a calculator program for you using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. See if you can get the code to work (suggestion: make a new folder for your new version of your calculator)

## Update your homepage to link to your lab02
Please update your homepage (the index.html page you made on the first day) so that it links to your completed `Lab 2` web pages. See Sarah's <a href="https://vanwars.github.io/ywtech-javascript" target="_blank">example homepage</a> (format the links however you like).
