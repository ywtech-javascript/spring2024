## Informal Share Outs / Presentations
In today's tutorial, you are going to share out your ideas and preliminary progress made on your final project.

### 1. Presenters
If you are presenting, make sure you cover the 4 reflective questions you submitted:
* What you’ve accomplished
* Challenges you’ve faced
* Next steps
* Changes in scope?

### 2. Listeners
If you are listening, give the presenter some feedback:
* Any techniques or libraries they should be aware of?
* One thing you like about their project
* One thing you might suggest that they consider

## Quiz 3 Prep
We have now covered all of the topics that will be assessed for Quiz 3. That said, these topics require practice in order to internalize, so we're going to keep reviewing and practicing a few questions in class.
