Some tags only work in conjunction with one another (which this guide refers to as "compound tags"). For instance, to make a list, you need a tag to indicate where the list starts and ends (either `<ol></ol>` or `<ul></ul>`) and a tag for each list item (`<li></li>`). Similarly, for a table, you need a way to indicate where the table starts and ends, where the row starts and ends, and how many cells exist in each row. Please see the code samples below:

## Lists
Sample code to make ordered and un-ordered lists:

## Tables
Sample code to make a table:
